# JSEngine
A 2D and 3D Javascript Game Engine. **Notice: A server is required for import to work properly**
View the [wiki page](https://github.com/ryandw11/JSEngine/wiki) for assistance on how to get started and documentation.

## Modes
There are two modes, 2D mode and 3D mode.

To select a mode you just import a different file.

## Using JSEngine
First you must install the module
```
npm install rjsengine
```
You use the import key word to import either the 2D or 3D Mode.
```javascript
import * as jsgame from './node_modules/rjsengine/JSEngine2D.js';

import * as jsgame from './node_modules/rjsengine/JSEngine3D.js';
```
That will give you access to all of the classes you need.
